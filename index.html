      <h1 class="w3-center">Mt Hood Timberline Lodge and Resort</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Constructed in 1937</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Timberline Lodge stands on the south slope of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 6,000 feet. This beautiful 55,000 square foot structure 
        rises out of a pristine alpine landscape and is still being used for its original intent – a magnificent ski lodge and mountain retreat for everyone to enjoy. Legendary 
        and awe-inspiring, it's a tribute to the rugged spirit of the Pacific Northwest. Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977, Timberline Lodge is one of Oregon’s most 
        popular tourist attractions, drawing nearly two million visitors every year. </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">TIMBERLINE SHINES WITH THE TIMES. The 1980 cult-classic film The Shining, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, 
        used aerial shots of Timberline as part of its opening scene. Film of the exterior of Timberline Lodge was used for some establishing shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel 
        throughout the movie. Several other shots in the film which purport to show the lodge, such as those of the hedge maze and loading dock, were taken at Elstree Studios in England, 
        using a mock-up of the south face of the lodge. Kubrick was asked not to depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the lodge might be 
        afraid to stay there. So a nonexistent room, Room 237, was substituted in the film. However, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline. Rest assured, 
        Timberline is not haunted! In the mid 1980s, snowboarding burst onto the scene. While considered a passing fad by some in the industry, it was and continues to be embraced and 
        encouraged at Timberline. History was made at Timberline when the first hand-dug half-pipes were built by young snowboarders. Snowboard parks design and technology were started 
        and perfected on the slopes of Timberline. The evolution of snowboarding continues to this day. In 1987, Richard invited his son Jeff to work in an executive role at 
        Timberline. Jeff had studied at Cornell University for their fine Hotel and Restaurant Management School, and then worked at hotels in Los Angeles and New York before 
        returning to Timberline. Jeff was promoted to president of R.L.K. and Company in 1992. He continues to serve in this role today. In the 1990s, new technologies and 
        subsequent chairlift replacements kept the ski area state-of-the-art and provided the feasibility necessary for winter skiing on the popular Palmer Snowfield during low 
        snow years. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Things to do at the mountain</h1><br>
      <h4>Explore The lodge</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">There is nothing quite like Timberline Lodge. From its unique architecture and amazing views to its cozy, but massive fireplaces and its seasonal 
        farm-to-table menu and award-winning wine, Timberline truly has it all. At just around an hour from downtown Portland, Timberline makes it easy to enjoy the Mountains 
        without driving for hours on end. </p><br>
    
      <h4>Go enjoy the slopes</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Timberline offers the longest ski season in North America. Historically, the winter season begins early to mid-November and continues through the end 
        of May. The Palmer Express high-speed quad operates in the Spring and Summer seasons only. Palmer allows us to operate later into the summer season than anyone else, 
        usually June 1st through beginning of September (snow dependent). Mt. Hood’s elevation is 11,245 feet. Timberline Lodge is located at 6,000 feet. Silcox Hut is at 7,000 feet.
         The highest operation point is the top of Palmer at 8,540 feet. The lowest operation point is the bottom of Summit Pass at 4,000 feet.
        </p><br>
    
      <h4>Try one of the many dining options</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Timberline offers exciting, fresh cuisine made with locally-sourced ingredients. From our seasonal menus to our award-winning wine program and 
        glacier-fed microbrewery, we put exceptional care and effort into every aspect of our guests' dining experience. Come taste everything that Timberline and the state of 
        Oregon have to offer.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Holiday Festivities</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Stay the night on Thursday, December 14th, when we officially light up Timberline's Christmas tree in the Main Headhouse. Afterwards, 
        continue the fun and help us decorate and carol the night away. This package is for any queen or small chalet hotel room and includes breakfast for two in the Cascade 
        Dining Room + a handmade keepsake ornament!</p><br>
    
      <h4>Go on a hike and take in all the views</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Timberline offers several hiking trails for all ages. The Buried Forest is a quick 1.8-mile out and back trail that is great for beginners. 
        While the Paradise Park trail is an out and back then ends in a loop that is a brisk 10-mile walk across the base of the mountain. </p>
