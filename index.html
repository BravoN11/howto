      <h1 class="w3-center">Mt Hood Timberline Lodge and resort</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Constructed in 1937</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Timberline Lodge stands on the south slope of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 6,000 feet. This beautiful 55,000 square foot structure 
        rises out of a pristine alpine landscape and is still being used for its original intent – a magnificent ski lodge and mountain retreat for everyone to enjoy. Legendary 
        and awe-inspiring, it's a tribute to the rugged spirit of the Pacific Northwest. Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977, Timberline Lodge is one of Oregon’s most 
        popular tourist attractions, drawing nearly two million visitors every year. </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">TIMBERLINE SHINES WITH THE TIMES. The 1980 cult-classic film The Shining, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, 
        used aerial shots of Timberline as part of its opening scene. Film of the exterior of Timberline Lodge was used for some establishing shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel 
        throughout the movie. Several other shots in the film which purport to show the lodge, such as those of the hedge maze and loading dock, were taken at Elstree Studios in England, 
        using a mock-up of the south face of the lodge. Kubrick was asked not to depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the lodge might be 
        afraid to stay there. So a nonexistent room, Room 237, was substituted in the film. However, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline. Rest assured, 
        Timberline is not haunted! In the mid 1980s, snowboarding burst onto the scene. While considered a passing fad by some in the industry, it was and continues to be embraced and 
        encouraged at Timberline. History was made at Timberline when the first hand-dug half-pipes were built by young snowboarders. Snowboard parks design and technology were started 
        and perfected on the slopes of Timberline. The evolution of snowboarding continues to this day. In 1987, Richard invited his son Jeff to work in an executive role at 
        Timberline. Jeff had studied at Cornell University for their fine Hotel and Restaurant Management School, and then worked at hotels in Los Angeles and New York before 
        returning to Timberline. Jeff was promoted to president of R.L.K. and Company in 1992. He continues to serve in this role today. In the 1990s, new technologies and 
        subsequent chairlift replacements kept the ski area state-of-the-art and provided the feasibility necessary for winter skiing on the popular Palmer Snowfield during low 
        snow years. </p>
